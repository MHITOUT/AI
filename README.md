# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This work finding the most similar pair of lines and the tf-idf representation.
This program uses the tf-idf vectors to find the most similar pair of lines in a given data set. 
This work required a bit more work than average. 


## Background

In my last job I nedded to find the most similar pair of lines. This was the best way.

## How is it used?

More kind of solution needed (environment, time, etc.) More kind of needs should be taken into account.

Becouse images will make README look nice! There is a cat:

## What next?

To grow my project I will need more javascript and dom skills.
